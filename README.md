# Image-To-Dot-Processing
Image to Dots Code for "Vapor David" Artwork in Processing

This code will take in an image and then place "dots" according to the brightness of the image.

It will also return a count and you can then use this information to 3D print them or bring them into other 3D programs for further processing.

In this cas I used this information to make a mixed media art work of which you can read more about below.

If you need to use different pixel dimensions just change the size() in the setup() where the width is twice as wide.
